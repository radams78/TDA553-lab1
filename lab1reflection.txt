1.  In Task one we decided to use the superclass Car, and let the subclasses, Saab95 and Volvo240, inherate the functionality of the car object.
    If we were ever to add another car, that would be as simple as creating a new subclass that inherates from car, change only what is nessecary
    within the subclass itself, in accordance with the Open-Closed Princpale.
2.  For the gas and break methods, we have limited inputs to the inteval [0,1], by throwing an error whenever the input falls outside the the range
    of the interval.
    For currentspeed we used Math.max and Math.min to make sure it was in the interval [0, enginespeed]
    Break and gas will never result in an incorrect speed manipulation due to the limiting interval [0,1], implemented above.
