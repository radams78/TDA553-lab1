1.  The method in Car checks if the amount the speed increases is between 0 - 1. We have a subclass to Car called Truck which Override the gas 
    method to add the canGas method that checks if the platform is in the correct position. Our design follow Liskov Substitution since we added
    a method in Truck which makes it possible to use the gas method without assigning the canGas method in subclasses. If you want to add a 
    soecific canGas method you need to Override the original method in Truck.

2.  We used subclassing for the gas function for Scania and CarTransporter size they both depended on the Car class. Otherwise we used
    two different delegations depending on the platforms function with a superclass to both delegations to handel the dublicate code
    between the two delegations. We used another delegation called LoadsCar which delegated to CarTransporter and RepairShop.

3.  Yes, in lab1 we implemented trim and turbo directly inside Volvo and Saab but to make them reuseable we changed them to delegations.
    If we thought more about the extenability of our classes we would have thought of a solution.
