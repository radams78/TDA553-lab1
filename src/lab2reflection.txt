1.  Your design probably has a type called something like Car or Vehicle that is a supertype to both Volvo and Scania. 
    What is the contract for gas() and brake() in this type? Do the implementations of gas() and brake() 
    both Volvo and Scania follow this contract? Does your design follow the Liskov Substitution Principle?

2.  How did you handle duplicated code between Scania, the car transporters and the repair shops? 
    Explain how you decided when to use subclassing and when to use composition and delegation.

3.  Did you need to modify the design from lab 1 in order to make these extensions? 
    If so, how could you have noticed that your design from Lab 1 did not follow the Open-Closed Principle before you 
    started working on Lab 2?
